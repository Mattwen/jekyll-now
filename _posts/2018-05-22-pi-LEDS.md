# Info

Raspberry Pi panel is powered with two 2.4v power adapters plus a Raspberry Pi HAT that does the hard work for panel display graphics. No need to wire each gpio pin to the LED panel. Panels are 32x16 and daisy chained together to make a 64x16 display.

# Fusion 360 Design

I also designed an enclosure to fit the loose wires and panels inside of, so it looks cleaner. Used Autodesk Fusion 360 and got the dimensions of the panels off Adafruit's website.

I also needed to print a riser for the LED panels to sit ontop of, the Pi and wires go underneath, riser is glued on the top half of the enclosure and seats the panels.

Then I put everything into Cura, sent to my 3D printer, and printed.

# Flask Controls

* Change the text/solid color of the RGB Screen
* Controllable via any web browser
* Can set the color of the text by inserting RGB values into the Flask form.
